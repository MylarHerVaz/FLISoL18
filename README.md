## About üïπ

[FLISoL](https://flisol.info/FLISOL2018/Mexico/Leon) is the largest Free Software dissemination event in Latin America and is aimed at all types of audiences: students, academics, businessmen, workers, public officials, enthusiasts and even people who do not have much computer knowledge.

This is a Python üêç workshop for the *'Festival Latinoamericano de Instalaci√≥n de Software Libre 2018'* ([FLISoL](https://flisol.info/FLISOL2018/Mexico/Leon)) at the *Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Le√≥n*, for which I was invited.

It is basically a 101 workshop about [*Artificial Neural Networks*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) using [Keras](https://keras.io/).


## Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

We'll be working on [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/) for which you can create and use a free account to train ANN models online.

A new library will be needed, and for this, you can import all the code from this repo: https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/FLISoL18


## Content üëæ

All repo content is contained inside the [main]() folder, in which you'll find a set of Jupyter Notebooks with the ANN code, along with a pre-trained model and a set of images use in the Notebooks.

Demo Gist for [PerceptronFLISoL18.py]() and [SigmoidFLISoL18.py]():
