## About üïπ

[FLISoL](https://flisol.info/FLISOL2018/Mexico/Leon) is the largest Free Software dissemination event in Latin America and is aimed at all types of audiences: students, academics, businessmen, workers, public officials, enthusiasts and even people who do not have much computer knowledge.

This is a Python üêç workshop for the *'Festival Latinoamericano de Instalaci√≥n de Software Libre 2018'* ([FLISoL](https://flisol.info/FLISOL2018/Mexico/Leon)) at the *Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Le√≥n*, for which I was invited.

It is basically a 101 workshop about [*Artificial Neural Networks*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) using [Keras](https://keras.io/).
